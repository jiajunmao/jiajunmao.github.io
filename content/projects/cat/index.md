<Me>: 
Write an ode to praise Wrigley and Fenway, two American domestic short hair cats
as the smartest, most troublesome, but cutest cats in existence in human history

[ChatGPT]:
Oh, Wrigley and Fenway, whiskered wonders rare,
In the realm of cats, none can quite compare.
Domestic short hairs, yet regal in grace,
You've etched your tales in the feline embrace.

Wrigley, oh sage of the scratching post,
Your cunning intellect is never to boast.
With eyes that gleam like the moonlit night,
You weave mischief with sheer delight.

Fenway, mischievous, a master of play,
Leaping through air in the most curious way.
Your antics, a ballet of fur and fun,
Underneath the gaze of the morning sun.

Together you dance, a duet so divine,
In the world of cats, your brilliance shines.
Wrigley, the thinker, plotting with glee,
Fenway, the acrobat, setting spirits free.

Troublesome twosome, a dynamic pair,
Leaving paw prints on hearts everywhere.
From tabletops to high shelves above,
You explore the realms with fearless love.

In the annals of history, your legend's inscribed,
Smartest of cats, in mischief you thrived.
No challenge too great for your cunning minds,
In the grand tapestry of feline finds.

Oh, Wrigley and Fenway, cuteness refined,
With fur as soft as dreams entwined.
Eyes that sparkle, mischief unfurls,
You are the darlings of this feline world.

In the grand saga of human history,
Your legacy, a tale of mystery.
Wrigley and Fenway, the cat's epitome,
A purring ode to your feline symphony.
